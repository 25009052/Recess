# Recess
The project i will be doing this recess(June)

This is my first project i did after i was done with the exams, 

The main purpose of this project is to allow users check if the a certain year is leap, century or both, a leap year contains 366 days and occurs every 4 years, except for end-of-century years, which must be divisible by 400 to be considered leap years.

The rules or guideline that the program follows 
if the year is divisible by 400 and 100 then the year is century and leap
non century but leap years must be disivible by 4 

what i faced with this project choosing the right conditions as one mistake would've resulted in the code being wrong.
