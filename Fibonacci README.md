The second project 

The main purpose of this purpose was to help me understand how fibonacci sequence works, using loops and scanner input... 
The program ask users to enter how many fibonacci numbers to run and the gives out output of a sequence starting from 0 

challenges 
it wasn't easy to translate orturn the fibonacci sequence using loop , kept choosing incorrect logic in the loop making the output to be incorrect.I had to take time to debug .
